# Imdb Movie Analysis SQL Project

## Project Overview

**Project Title**: Imdb Movie Analysis
**Database**: `movies_db`

This project showcases my SQL expertise through a comprehensive analysis of a movie dataset. It involves conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) and addressing specific business and analytical questions using SQL queries. By analyzing the dataset, we extracted meaningful insights that can guide and support the initiation of their new project.

## Objectives

1.**Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform an in-depth exploration of the movie dataset.

2.**Address Business Questions**: Use SQL queries to answer targeted business and analytical questions, providing actionable insights into the movie dataset.
   
3.**Generate Data-Driven Insights**: Analyze the dataset to uncover key metrics and insights that can inform and support the development of a new project.

4.**Showcase SQL Expertise**: Demonstrate advanced SQL skills by designing, querying, and analyzing the dataset effectively to meet the projectâ€™s objectives.

##  1.Data Explorations.

  -**1. View the Structure of the Table**:

  -**2. Summary of the Dataset**:

  -**3. Count the Number of Movies Released Per Year**:

  -**4. Top 10 Movies by Imdb Rating**:

  ```sql
           DESCRIBE movies;

           SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_movies FROM movies;
     
           SELECT release_year, COUNT(*) AS movie_count
		       FROM movies
		       GROUP BY release_year
		       ORDER BY release_year DESC;

           SELECt title, imdb_rating
           FROM movies
           ORDER BY imdb_rating DESC
           LIMIT 10;

```

### 3. Data Analysis & Findings

The following SQL queries were developed to answer specific business questions:

1.**Write a SQL query to Print all movie titles and release year for all Marvel Studios movies.**
```sql
select title , release_year from movies 
 where studio="marvel studios";
```

2. **Write a SQL query to print all movies that have Avenger in their name**:
```sql
select title from movies
where title like '%avenger%';
```

3. **Write a SQL query to print all movies that have Avenger in their name**:
```sql
select title from movies
where title like '%avenger%';
```

4. **Write a SQL query to find the average age of customers who purchased items from the 'Beauty' category.**:
```sql
SELECT
    ROUND(AVG(age), 2) as avg_age
FROM retail_sales
WHERE category = 'Beauty';
```

5. **Write a SQL query to Select all THOR movies by their release year**:
```sql
  select title , release_year from movies
	where title like "%thor%"
	order by release_year;
```

6. **Write a SQL query to Print a year and how many movies were released in that year starting with the latest year**:
```sql
 select release_year, count(*) as total_movies 
  from movies
   group by release_year
    order by release_year;
```

7. **Write a SQL query to Show all Telugu movie names (assuming you don't know the languageid for Telugu)**:
```sql
  select title 
                 from movies m
				  left join languages l
				   on m.language_id = l.language_id
				    where l.name="telugu";
;
```

8. **Write a SQL query to find the top 5 customers based on the highest total sales **:
```sql
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    SUM(total_sale) as total_sales
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

9. **Write a SQL query to find the number of unique customers who purchased items from each category.**:
```sql
SELECT 
    category,    
    COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) as cnt_unique_cs
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY category;
```

10. **Write a SQL query to create each shift and number of orders (Example Morning <12, Afternoon Between 12 & 17, Evening >17)**:
```sql
WITH hourly_sale
AS
(
SELECT *,
    CASE
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM sale_time) < 12 THEN 'Morning'
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM sale_time) BETWEEN 12 AND 17 THEN 'Afternoon'
        ELSE 'Evening'
    END as shift
FROM retail_sales
)
SELECT 
    shift,
    COUNT(*) as total_orders    
FROM hourly_sale
GROUP BY shift;
```
