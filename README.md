# Imdb Movie Analysis SQL Project

## Project Overview

**Project Title**: Imdb Movie Analysis
**Database**: `movies_db`

This project showcases my SQL expertise through a comprehensive analysis of a movie dataset. It involves conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) and addressing specific business and analytical questions using SQL queries. By analyzing the dataset, we extracted meaningful insights that can guide and support the initiation of their new project.

## Objectives

1.**Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform an in-depth exploration of the movie dataset.

2.**Address Business Questions**: Use SQL queries to answer targeted business and analytical questions, providing actionable insights into the movie dataset.
   
3.**Generate Data-Driven Insights**: Analyze the dataset to uncover key metrics and insights that can inform and support the development of a new project.

4.**Showcase SQL Expertise**: Demonstrate advanced SQL skills by designing, querying, and analyzing the dataset effectively to meet the projectâ€™s objectives.
